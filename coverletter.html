Dear Anne,</h5>
 <p>
I am writing to you regarding your Customer Service Administrator opening. I have been working as a IT Helpdesk support analyst and later as an IT Quality Assurance Test analyst both at the IT department of Irish Life health. During this time, I’ve developed impeccable customer service manners and an ability to politely deal with customers (both internal and external) who have issues with the working of their software. </p>
<p>
I am accustomed to working on multiple projects simultaneously, and can offer help in the customer department to achieve set targets in a timely and efficient manner and to grow and surpass all goals and objectives.</p>
<p>
Duties at my previous role included making calls daily to churches and private individuals; as part of planning and implementing outdoor events for churches in Ireland and the UK in order to organize participation in these events.</p>
<p>
During my tenure, I implemented new strategies in collation and analysis of data, using tools such as excel and Power BI, reducing expenses significantly and largely increasing response and participation rates.</p>
<p>
My experience at RCCG has helped me improve my leadership skills, hone my organizational skills, and has provided me with extensive knowledge of how to upsell and brand ideas to potential clients.</p>
<p>
I also worked at as an Independent business representative for the American Communications Network, where I further cultivated useful customer service abilities while selling of products and services such as Gas, Electricity, Telephone and broadband. Included in my responsibilities, were to come up with business ideas and conduct product presentations, whilst also recruiting business partners to the business</p>
<p>
I handled technical support for clients on a wide range of company products. Whilst working there, I was able to resolve issues at more than a 90% rate and memorize an entire line of company products & services – including prices and special discounts.</p>
<p>
I’m looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill the requirements for the Customer Service Representative position at Great West Lifeco. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>

Moses Ademokun.
